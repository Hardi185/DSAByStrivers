# Problem Statement: 
Given an array of numbers, you need to return the count of reverse pairs. Reverse Pairs are those pairs where i<j and arr[i]>2*arr[j].

### Example 1:
- Input:
 N = 5, array[] = {1,3,2,3,1)

- Output
: 2 

- Explanation:
 The pairs are (3, 1) and (3, 1) as from both the pairs the condition arr[i] > 2*arr[j] is satisfied.

### Example 2:
- Input:
 N = 4, array[] = {3,2,1,4}

- Output:
 1

- Explaination: 
There is only 1 pair  ( 3 , 1 ) that satisfy the condition arr[i] > 2*arr[j]

## Complexity comparision:


| **Approach**               | **Time Complexity**   | **Space Complexity**  | **Remarks**                                      |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach 1: Brute Force**  | `O(n^2)`              | `O(1)`                | Simple but highly inefficient for large inputs.  |
| **Approach 2: Optimized with Sorting** | ` O(2N*logN)`  Inside the mergeSort() we call merge() and countPairs() except mergeSort() itself. Now, inside the function countPairs(), though we are running a nested loop, we are actually iterating the left half once and the right half once in total. That is why, the time complexity is O(N). And the merge() function also takes O(N). The mergeSort() takes O(logN) time complexity. Therefore, the overall time complexity will be O(logN * (N+N)) = O(2N*logN).       | `O(n)`               | Efficient for larger datasets; requires additional space. |
