# Problem Statement: 
Given an array of N integers. Find the elements that appear more than N/3 times in the array. If no such element exists, return an empty vector.

### Example 1:
- Input Format
: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,2,3,2}
- Result
: 2
- Explanation:
 Here we can see that the Count(1) = 1, Count(2) = 3 and Count(3) = 1.Therefore, the count of 2 is greater than N/3 times. Hence, 2 is the answer.

### Example 2:
- Input Format
:  N = 6, array[] = {11,33,33,11,33,11}
- Result:
 11 33
- Explanation:
 Here we can see that the Count(11) = 3 and Count(33) = 3. Therefore, the count of both 11 and 33 is greater than N/3 times. Hence, 11 and 33 is the answer.

| **Approach**                     | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** | **Explanation**                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach 1 (Brute Force)**      | `O(nÂ²)`             | `O(1)`               | For each element, counts its occurrences by traversing the array again. Stops early when two majority elements are found. |
| **Approach 2 (Using HashMap)**    | `O(n)`              | `O(n)`               | Uses a hash map to store frequencies and checks if any frequency exceeds `n / 3`. Handles duplicates efficiently. |
| **Approach 3 (Boyer-Moore Voting)** | `O(n)`             | `O(1)`               | Uses counters and variables to find majority elements in one pass, followed by verification. Optimized in time and space. |
