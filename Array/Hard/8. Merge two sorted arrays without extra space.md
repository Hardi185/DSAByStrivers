# Problem statement: 
Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes n and m in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order. Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 so that it contains the last M elements.

### Example 1:
- Input:
 
n = 4, arr1[] = [1 4 8 10] 
m = 5, arr2[] = [2 3 9]

- Output:
 
arr1[] = [1 2 3 4]
arr2[] = [8 9 10]

- Explanation:

After merging the two non-decreasing arrays, we get, 1,2,3,4,8,9,10.

### Example2:
- Input:
 
n = 4, arr1[] = [1 3 5 7] 
m = 5, arr2[] = [0 2 6 8 9]

- Output:
 
arr1[] = [0 1 2 3]
arr2[] = [5 6 7 8 9]

- Explanation:

After merging the two non-decreasing arrays, we get, 0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9.

## Complexity comparision:

| **Approach**                  | **Time Complexity**                          | **Space Complexity** | **Remarks**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach 1: HashSet**       | `O(n+m) + O(n+m)`  O(n+m) is for copying the elements from arr1[] and arr2[] to arr3[]. And another O(n+m) is for filling back the two given arrays from arr3[].                       | `O(n + m)`           | Simple and efficient, ideal for unsorted arrays with moderate sizes.       |
| **Approach 2: Two Pointers**  | `O(min(n, m)) + O(n*logn) + O(m*logm),` O(min(n, m)) is for swapping the array elements. And O(n*logn) and O(m*logm) are for sorting the two arrays.         | `O(1)`               | Optimized for minimal space usage, works well with sorted arrays.          |
| **Approach 3: Merge Sort**    | `O((n+m)*log(n+m))`  he gap is ranging from n+m to 1 and every time the gap gets divided by 2. So, the time complexity of the outer loop will be O(log(n+m)). Now, for each value of the gap, the inner loop can at most run for (n+m) times. So, the time complexity of the inner loop will be O(n+m). So, the overall time complexity will be O((n+m)*log(n+m)).                   | `O(1)`               | Suitable for scenarios where both arrays need sorting or pre-sorted data.  |
