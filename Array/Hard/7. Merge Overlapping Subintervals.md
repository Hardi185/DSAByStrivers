# Problem Statement: 
Given an array of intervals, merge all the overlapping intervals and return an array of non-overlapping intervals.

### Example 1:
- Input:
 intervals=[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

- Output:
 [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

- Explanation:
 Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] are overlapping we can merge them to form [1,6]
 intervals.

### Example 2:
- Input:
 [[1,4],[4,5]]

- Output:
 [[1,5]]

- Explanation:
 Since intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are overlapping we can merge them to form [1,5].

## Complexity comparision:


| **Approach**                 | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** | **Remarks**                                                |
|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach 1: Nested Loops** | `O(N*logN) + O(2*N),`    Sorting the given array takes  O(N*logN) time complexity. Now, after that, we are using 2 loops i and j. But while using loop i, we skip all the intervals that are merged with loop j. So, we can conclude that every interval is roughly visited twice(roughly, once for checking or skipping and once for merging). So, the time complexity will be 2*N instead of N2.         | `O(n)`               | Less efficient, impractical for large inputs.              |
| **Approach 2: Two Pointers** | ` O(N*logN) + O(N)`  Sorting the given array takes  O(N*logN) time complexity. Now, after that, we are just using a single loop that runs for N times. So, the time complexity will be O(N).       | `O(n)`               | Efficient, leverages sorting and skips duplicates easily.  |
