# Problem Statement: 
Given an array of N integers, your task is to find unique triplets that add up to give a sum of zero. In short, you need to return an array of all the unique triplets [arr[a], arr[b], arr[c]] such that i!=j, j!=k, k!=i, and their sum is equal to zero.

### Example 1:
- Input:
 nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
- Output:
 [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
- Explanation:
 Out of all possible unique triplets possible, [-1,-1,2] and [-1,0,1] satisfy the condition of summing up to zero with i!=j!=k

### Example 2:
- Input:
 nums=[-1,0,1,0]
- Output: [[-1,0,1],[-1,1,0]]
- Explanation:
 Out of all possible unique triplets possible, [-1,0,1] and [-1,1,0] satisfy the condition of summing up to zero with i!=j!=k

| **Approach**                          | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity**   | **Explanation**                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach 1 (Brute Force)**         | `O(N3 * log(no. of unique triplets))`  Here, we are mainly using 3 nested loops. And inserting triplets into the set takes O(log(no. of unique triplets)) time complexity. But we are not considering the time complexity of sorting as we are just sorting 3 elements every time.            | `O(2 * no. of the unique triplets)` (due to HashSet) | Uses three nested loops to check all triplet combinations, and a HashSet to ensure uniqueness, resulting in `O(n³)` time complexity. |
| **Approach 2 (Using HashSet for Pairs)** | `O(N2 * log(no. of unique triplets))` Here, we are mainly using 3 nested loops. And inserting triplets into the set takes O(log(no. of unique triplets)) time complexity. But we are not considering the time complexity of sorting as we are just sorting 3 elements every time.           | ` O(2 * no. of the unique triplets) + O(N) `                  | Uses a HashSet to store seen elements while searching for the third element. Reduces time complexity to `O(n²)`.  |
| **Approach 3 (Two Pointers After Sorting)** | `O(NlogN)+O(N2)` The pointer i, is running for approximately N times. And both the pointers j and k combined can run for approximately N times including the operation of skipping duplicates. So the total time complexity will be O(N2).            | `O(no. of quadruplets)`                  | After sorting the array, uses two pointers to find triplets and ensures uniqueness by skipping duplicates. Time complexity is `O(n²)`. |
