# Problem Statement: 
Given a Matrix, print the given matrix in spiral order.

### Example 1:
- Input: Matrix[][] = { { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
		      { 5, 6, 7, 8 },
		      { 9, 10, 11, 12 },
	              { 13, 14, 15, 16 } }
- Outhput: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10.
- Explanation: The output of matrix in spiral form.

### Example 2:
- Input: Matrix[][] = { { 1, 2, 3 },
	              { 4, 5, 6 },
		      { 7, 8, 9 } }
			    
- Output: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5.
- Explanation: The output of matrix in spiral form.

### Time Complexity: O(m x n) { Since all the elements are being traversed once and there are total n x m elements ( m elements in each row and total n rows) so the time complexity will be O(n x m)}.

### Space Complexity: O(n) { Extra Space used for storing traversal in the ans array }.
