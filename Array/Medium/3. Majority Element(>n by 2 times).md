# Majority Element Problem

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, the task is to find the **majority element**.  
The majority element is defined as the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input**: `nums = [3,2,3]`  
- **Output**: `3`  

### Example 2:
- **Input**: `nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]`  
- **Output**: `2`

## Complexity Comparision

| **Approach**                   | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** | **Explanation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach 1: Brute Force**    | `O(n²)`            | `O(1)`               | Iterates through the array for each element to count its frequency, leading to a quadratic complexity. |
| **Approach 2: Hash Map (Counting)** | `O(n)`          | `O(n)`               | Uses a hash map to store the frequency of elements, making it linear in time but requiring extra space. |
| **Approach 3: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm** | `O(n)`       | `O(1)`               | Traverses the array to identify the majority candidate, followed by a validation step, both in linear time. |
