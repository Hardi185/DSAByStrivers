# Problem Statement: 
Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 and then return the matrix.

### Example 1:

- Input: matrix=[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
- Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
- Explanation: Since matrix[2][2]=0.Therfore the 2nd column and 2nd row wil be set to 0.

### Example 2:

- Input: matrix=[[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
- Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]
- Explanation:
Since matrix[0][0]=0 and matrix[0][3]=0. Therefore 1st row, 1st column and 4th column will be set to 0

| **Approach**                      | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** | **Explanation**                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach 1 (Mark Rows & Cols with -1)** | `O(n × m × (n + m))` | `O(1)`               | For every 0 in the matrix, traverse the entire row and column to mark them. Update the matrix in a second pass.   |
| **Approach 2 (Separate Row & Col Arrays)** | `O(n × m)`           | `O(n + m)`           | Use two arrays to track rows and columns to be zeroed. Traverse the matrix twice: once to populate arrays, and once to update the matrix.     |
| **Approach 3 (In-place Marking)**          | `O(n × m)`           | `O(1)`               | Use the first row and column of the matrix as markers to avoid additional space. Update the matrix in a second pass.|
