# Pascal's Triangle Problem Variations

## Problem Statement
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It starts with a single `1` at the top. This problem has **three variations**:

1. **Variation 1**: Given row number `r` and column number `c`, print the element at position `(r, c)` in Pascal’s Triangle.
    - **Example**:
      Input: `r = 5, c = 3`  
      Output: `6`  
      Explanation: The element at position `(5, 3)` is `6`.

2. **Variation 2**: Given the row number `n`, print the entire `n-th` row of Pascal’s Triangle.
   - **Example**:
     Input: `n = 4`  
     Output: `[1, 3, 3, 1]`  
     Explanation: The 4th row of Pascal’s Triangle is `[1, 3, 3, 1]`.

3. **Variation 3**: Given the number of rows `n`,print the first `n` rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
   - **Variation 3 Example**:
     Input: `n = 3`  
     Output:  1 1 1 1 2 1
