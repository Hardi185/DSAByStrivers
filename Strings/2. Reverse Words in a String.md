# PROBLEM:
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

```yaml
Example 1:
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Example 3:
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

## CODE:
```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {

        System.out.println("s" + s);
        String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        System.out.println("words array: " + Arrays.toString(words));
        StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder();

        // Reverse the order of words
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            System.out.println("index" + i);
            System.out.println("words" + words[i]);
            reversed.append(words[i]);
            if (i > 0) {
                System.out.println("enter condition i > 0");
                reversed.append(" ");
                }
        }

        return reversed.toString();
    }
}
````

## SOLUTION:
1. Split the string based on space and store words to string array, initialize stringBuilder to store reversed string
2. Loop through the string array in reverse and add words to reversedString.
also add spaces after each word util we found the last index (i =0, in which space will not be added because it is last word)
