A graph is a data structure used to model pairwise relationships between objects. It consists of two main components:

**Vertices (Nodes):** These are the individual entities or points in the graph. They can represent anything from people in a social network, cities in a map, or tasks in a project.

**Edges (Links):** These are the connections between pairs of vertices. They represent the relationships or interactions between the entities.
