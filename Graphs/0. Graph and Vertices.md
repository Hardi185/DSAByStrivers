Given an integer n representing number of vertices. Find out how many undirected graphs (not necessarily connected) can be constructed out of a given n number of vertices.

```yaml
Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: 5
Output: 1024
```

---

## Code:
```java
public class UndirectedGraphs {
    public static int countGraphs(int n) {
        // Calculate total edges in an undirected graph with n vertices
        int totalEdges = (n * (n - 1)) / 2;
        
        // Total graphs = 2^(totalEdges)
        return (int) Math.pow(2, totalEdges);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example inputs
        int n1 = 2;
        int n2 = 5;

        System.out.println("Number of graphs for " + n1 + " vertices: " + countGraphs(n1));
        System.out.println("Number of graphs for " + n2 + " vertices: " + countGraphs(n2));
    }
}
```
