class Main {
   static void pattern1(int N)
{
    // This is the outer loop which will loop for the rows.
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
         // This is the inner loop which here, loops for the columns
        // as we have to print a rectangular pattern.
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
        {
            System.out.print("* ");
        }

         // As soon as N stars are printed, we move to the
        // next row and give a line break otherwise all stars
        // would get printed in 1 line.
        System.out.println();
    }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Here, we have taken the value of N as 5.
        // We can also take input from the user.
        int N = 5;
