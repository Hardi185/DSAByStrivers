# Problem Statement: 
Given an array of integers arr, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

### Examples:

```yaml
Example 1:
Input: arr = [4,0,-1,3,5,3,6,8], k = 3
Output: [4,3,5,5,6,8]
Explanation: 

Window position                   Max
------------------------         -----
[4  0  -1] 3  5  3  6  8           4
 4 [0  -1  3] 5  3  6  8           3
 4  0 [-1  3  5] 3  6  8           5
 4  0  -1 [3  5  3] 6  8           5
 4  0  -1  3 [5  3  6] 8           6
 4  0  -1  3  5 [3  6  8]          8

For each window of size k=3, we find the maximum element in the window and add it to our output array.

Example 2:
Input: arr= [20,25], k = 2
Output: [25]

Explanation: Thereâ€™s just one window is size 2 that is possible and the maximum of the two elements is our answer.
