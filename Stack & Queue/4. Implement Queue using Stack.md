# Queue Implementation Using Two Stacks

This project demonstrates how to implement a queue data structure using two stacks. The queue follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** rule, and the stack follows the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** rule.

## Problem Statement

Given a stack with some elements, implement a queue using two stacks. Implement the following queue operations:

1. `push(x)`: Push an element `x` to the back of the queue.
2. `pop()`: Remove the element from the front of the queue and return it.
3. `peek()`: Return the front element of the queue without removing it.
4. `size()`: Return the current size of the queue.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Using Two Stacks where Push Operation is O(N)

In this approach, every time an element is pushed, we move all the elements from the input stack to the output stack, push the new element to the input stack, and then move all elements back to the input stack. This results in O(N) time complexity for each push operation.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class MyQueue {
    Stack < Integer > input = new Stack < > ();
    Stack < Integer > output = new Stack < > ();

    // Initialize the data structure
    public MyQueue() {}

    // Push element x to the back of the queue
    public void push(int x) {
        while (input.empty() == false) {
            output.push(input.peek());
            input.pop();
        }
        System.out.println("The element pushed is " + x);
        input.push(x);
        while (output.empty() == false) {
            input.push(output.peek());
            output.pop();
        }
    }

    // Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns that element
    public int pop() {
        if (input.empty()) {
            System.out.println("Stack is empty");
        }
        int val = input.peek();
        input.pop();
        return val;
    }

    // Get the front element
    public int peek() {
        if (input.empty()) {
            System.out.println("Stack is empty");
        }
        return input.peek();
    }

    // Returns the size of the queue
    int size() {
        return input.size();
    }
}

class TUF {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        MyQueue q = new MyQueue();
        q.push(3);
        q.push(4);
        System.out.println("The element poped is " + q.pop());
        q.push(5);
        System.out.println("The top element is " + q.peek());
        System.out.println("The size of the queue is " + q.size());
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
Push Operation: O(N) where N is the number of elements in the queue.
Pop Operation: O(1), as we simply remove an element from the input stack.
Peek Operation: O(1), as we simply access the top of the input stack.
Size Operation: O(1), as we simply return the size of the input stack.

### Space Complexity:
Space Complexity: O(2N), as we use two stacks, each potentially holding all the elements of the queue.

### Approach 2: Using Two Stacks where Push Operation is O(1)

In this optimized approach, the push operation works in O(1) time complexity by simply pushing elements onto the input stack. The pop and peek operations, however, involve moving elements from the input stack to the output stack.

```java
import java.util.*;

class MyQueue {
    Stack < Integer > input = new Stack < > ();
    Stack < Integer > output = new Stack < > ();

    // Initialize the data structure
    public MyQueue() {}

    // Push element x to the back of the queue
    public void push(int x) {
        System.out.println("The element pushed is " + x);
        input.push(x);
    }

    // Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns that element
    public int pop() {
        if (output.empty())
            while (input.empty() == false) {
                output.push(input.peek());
                input.pop();
            }
        int x = output.peek();
        output.pop();
        return x;
    }

    // Get the front element
    public int peek() {
        if (output.empty())
            while (input.empty() == false) {
                output.push(input.peek());
                input.pop();
            }
        return output.peek();
    }

    // Returns the size of the queue
    int size() {
        return (output.size() + input.size());
    }
}

class TUF {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        MyQueue q = new MyQueue();
        q.push(3);
        q.push(4);
        System.out.println("The element poped is " + q.pop());
        q.push(5);
        System.out.println("The top element is " + q.peek());
        System.out.println("The size of the queue is " + q.size());
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- Push Operation: O(1), as elements are pushed onto the input stack.
- Pop Operation: O(N), in the worst case when the output stack is empty, we transfer all elements from the input stack to the output stack.
- Peek Operation: O(N), in the worst case when the output stack is empty, we transfer all elements from the input stack to the output stack.
- Size Operation: O(1), as we simply return the combined size of the input and output stacks.

### Space Complexity:
Space Complexity: O(2N), as we use two stacks to store the elements of the queue.
