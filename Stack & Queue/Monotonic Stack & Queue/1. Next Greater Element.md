# Next Greater Element in Circular Array

## Problem Statement
Given a circular integer array `A`, return the next greater element for every element in `A`. The next greater element for an element `x` is the first element greater than `x` that we come across while traversing the array in a clockwise manner. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this element.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`N = 11, A = {3,10,4,2,1,2,6,1,7,2,9}`

**Output:**  
`10,-1,6,6,2,6,7,7,9,9,10`

**Explanation:**  
For the first element in `A` (i.e., 3), the greater element which comes next to it while traversing and is closest to it is 10. Hence, 10 is present at index 0 in the resultant array. Similarly, the next greater element for other elements is computed.

#### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`N = 6, A = {5,7,1,2,6,0}`

**Output:**  
`7,-1,7,6,7,5`

## Algorithm

### Steps:
1. **Initialize Data Structures:**
   - Create a stack to store indices.
   - Create an array `nge` of size `n` initialized with `-1` (for elements with no greater next element).

2. **Iterate from End to Start:**
   - Loop from `2n-1` to `0` (to simulate circular behavior).
   - For each index `i % n`:
     - Pop elements from the stack while the stack is not empty and the top element is less than or equal to the current array element.
     - If the stack is not empty, the top of the stack is the next greater element for the current element.
     - Push the current element index onto the stack.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the filled `nge` array.

## Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class NextGreaterElement {
    public static int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] nge = new int[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (int i = 2 * n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() <= nums[i % n]) {
                stack.pop();
            }

            if (i < n) {
                nge[i] = stack.isEmpty() ? -1 : stack.peek();
            }

            stack.push(nums[i % n]);
        }

        return nge;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {5, 7, 1, 2, 6, 0};
        int[] result = nextGreaterElements(arr);

        System.out.println("The next greater elements are:");
        for (int n : result) {
            System.out.print(n + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

## Example Execution

### Example 1:
Input: `N = 6, A = {5,7,1,2,6,0}`

| Iteration | Stack         | NGE Array          |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|
| i = 11    | [0]           | [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]|
| i = 10    | [6]           | [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]|
| i = 9     | [7]           | [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]|
| i = 8     | [7,6]         | [-1,-1,-1,-1, 7,-1]|
| i = 7     | [7,6,2]       | [-1,-1,-1, 6, 7,-1]|
| i = 6     | [7]           | [-1,-1, 7, 6, 7,-1]|
| i = 5     | [7]           | [ 7,-1, 7, 6, 7,-1]|

**Final Output:** `[7,-1,7,6,7,5]`

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - For storing indices in the stack and the result array.

---

## Key Points
- This algorithm efficiently handles circular arrays using modular arithmetic.
- The stack ensures constant time operations for maintaining the next greater elements.
