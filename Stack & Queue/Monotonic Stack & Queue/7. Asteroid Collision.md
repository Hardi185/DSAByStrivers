Problem Breakdown
We are given an array asteroids where:

Positive integers represent asteroids moving to the right.
Negative integers represent asteroids moving to the left.
When two asteroids collide, the smaller one explodes. If they are the same size, both explode.
We need to find the state of the asteroids after all collisions.

```yaml
Example 1:

Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.
Example 2:

Input: asteroids = [8,-8]
Output: []
Explanation: The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.
Example 3:

Input: asteroids = [10,2,-5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
```

Algorithm

Brute Force Approach
Loop over the asteroids list.
For each asteroid, check if it collides with the next asteroid in the list.
If a collision happens, remove the smaller one or both if they are the same size.
Continue until no further collisions occur.


Stack-Based Optimized Approach
Create an empty stack.
Traverse through the asteroids list:
If the asteroid is moving right (positive), push it onto the stack.
If the asteroid is moving left (negative):
Check the asteroid on top of the stack.
If the top of the stack is also moving right, a collision happens.
Handle the collision based on size, adjusting the stack accordingly.
At the end of the loop, the stack will contain the final state of the asteroids.

Step-by-Step Execution with Tables
Example 1: asteroids = [5, 10, -5]
Brute Force Approach:

Step	Asteroids Before	Collision Occurs	Asteroids After	Collision Result
1	[5, 10, -5]	Yes (10 and -5)	[5, 10, 0]	10 survives
2	[5, 10, 0]	No	[5, 10]	
Final Result: [5, 10]

Stack Approach:

Step	Stack Before	Current Asteroid	Action	Stack After
1	[]	5	Push	[5]
2	[5]	10	Push	[5, 10]
3	[5, 10]	-5	Pop (10 survives)	[5, 10]
Final Result: [5, 10]
