# Trapping Rain Water Problem

This repository contains different approaches to solving the "Trapping Rain Water" problem. The task is to compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks after raining, given an elevation map represented by an array where each element is the height of a block.

## Problem Description

Given an array of non-negative integers representing the height of blocks, where the width of each block is 1, compute the amount of water that can be trapped between the blocks after raining.

### Example:
Input: `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`  
Output: `6`

Explanation: The total amount of trapped rainwater is 6 units.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Brute Force Approach

#### Algorithm:

1. For each index `i`, find the maximum height to the left (`leftMax[i]`) and maximum height to the right (`rightMax[i]`).
2. The water trapped at index `i` is the difference between the minimum of `leftMax[i]` and `rightMax[i]` and the height at index `i`.
3. Sum up the water trapped at all indices to get the total water trapped.

#### Time Complexity:
- O(N^2), as for each index we calculate the left and right maximum heights.

#### Space Complexity:
- O(1), since no extra space is used apart from the input array.

#### Code:
```
import java.util.*;
class TUF {
    static int trap(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int waterTrapped = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int j = i;
            int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;
            while (j >= 0) {
                leftMax = Math.max(leftMax, arr[j]);
                j--;
            }
            j = i;
            while (j < n) {
                rightMax = Math.max(rightMax, arr[j]);
                j++;
            }
            waterTrapped += Math.min(leftMax, rightMax) - arr[i];
        }
        return waterTrapped;
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr[] = {0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1};
        System.out.println("The duplicate element is " + trap(arr));
    }
}
```

### Solution 2: Optimized Approach with Precomputation

#### Algorithm:

1. Create two arrays `prefix[]` (for left maximum) and `suffix[]` (for right maximum).
2. Precompute `prefix[i]` as the maximum height from the left up to index `i`.
3. Precompute `suffix[i]` as the maximum height from the right up to index `i`.
4. For each index `i`, the water trapped is calculated as `min(prefix[i], suffix[i]) - height[i]`.
5. Sum up the water trapped at all indices to get the total water trapped.

#### Time Complexity:
- O(3N), as we traverse the array three times: once for the prefix array, once for the suffix array, and once for calculating the trapped water.

#### Space Complexity:
- O(N) for both the `prefix[]` and `suffix[]` arrays.

#### Code:
```java
import java.util.*;
class TUF {
    static int trap(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int prefix[] = new int[n];
        int suffix[] = new int[n];
        prefix[0] = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            prefix[i] = Math.max(prefix[i - 1], arr[i]);
        }
        suffix[n - 1] = arr[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            suffix[i] = Math.max(suffix[i + 1], arr[i]);
        }
        int waterTrapped = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            waterTrapped += Math.min(prefix[i], suffix[i]) - arr[i];
        }
        return waterTrapped;
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr[] = {0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1};
        System.out.println("The duplicate element is " + trap(arr));
    }
}
```

### Solution 3: Optimal Solution (Two-Pointer Approach)

#### Algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers `l` (left pointer) and `r` (right pointer) at the beginning and end of the array.
2. Initialize `leftMax` and `rightMax` to 0.
3. If `height[l] <= height[r]`, check if `leftMax` is less than `height[l]`. If it is, update `leftMax`, else compute the trapped water at `l` and move `l` to the right.
4. If `height[l] > height[r]`, check if `rightMax` is less than `height[r]`. If it is, update `rightMax`, else compute the trapped water at `r` and move `r` to the left.
5. Repeat this until the two pointers cross each other.

#### Time Complexity:
- O(N), as we only need a single pass through the array with two pointers.

#### Space Complexity:
- O(1), since no extra space is used.

#### Code:
```java
import java.util.*;
class TUF {
    static int trap(int[] height) {
        int n = height.length;
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        int res = 0;
        int maxLeft = 0, maxRight = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
                if (height[left] >= maxLeft) {
                    maxLeft = height[left];
                } else {
                    res += maxLeft - height[left];
                }
                left++;
            } else {
                if (height[right] >= maxRight) {
                    maxRight = height[right];
                } else {
                    res += maxRight - height[right];
                }
                right--;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }


    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr[] = {0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1};
        System.out.println("The duplicate element is " + trap(arr));
    }
}
```
