# Prefix to Infix Conversion

## Problem Statement
Given a prefix expression, the task is to convert it into an infix expression.

### Examples:
#### Example 1:
**Input:** `*-A/BC-/AKL`

**Output:** `((A-(B/C))*((A/K)-L))`

**Explanation:** The given prefix expression is converted to its equivalent infix form by following the rules of prefix to infix conversion.

#### Example 2:
**Input:** `*+AB-CD`

**Output:** `((A+B)*(C-D))`

**Explanation:** The given prefix expression is converted to its equivalent infix form.

## Algorithm
The prefix to infix conversion is performed by processing the prefix expression from right to left. The operands are appended to a stack, and when an operator is encountered, the top two operands are popped, combined into an infix expression, and pushed back onto the stack.

### Steps:
1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Read the prefix expression from right to left.
3. For each character:
   - If it is an operand, push it onto the stack.
   - If it is an operator:
     - Pop the top two elements from the stack.
     - Combine them into an infix expression with the operator in between, and parentheses around the expression.
     - Push the resulting string back onto the stack.
4. After processing all characters, the stack will contain a single element, which is the final infix expression.

## Operator Precedence Table
| Operator | Precedence |
|----------|------------|
| `^`      | Highest    |
| `* /`    | Medium     |
| `+ -`    | Lowest     |

## Java Code
```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class PrefixToInfix {

    // Method to check if a character is an operator
    private static boolean isOperator(char c) {
        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/' || c == '^';
    }

    // Method to convert prefix to infix
    public static String prefixToInfix(String prefix) {
        Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();

        // Process the prefix expression from right to left
        for (int i = prefix.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            char ch = prefix.charAt(i);

            // If the character is an operand, push it to the stack
            if (Character.isLetterOrDigit(ch)) {
                stack.push(String.valueOf(ch));
            } 
            // If the character is an operator
            else if (isOperator(ch)) {
                // Pop two elements from the stack
                String operand1 = stack.pop();
                String operand2 = stack.pop();

                // Form the infix expression
                String infix = "(" + operand1 + ch + operand2 + ")";

                // Push the resulting string back onto the stack
                stack.push(infix);
            }
        }

        // The final element in the stack is the result
        return stack.peek();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String prefix1 = "*-A/BC-/AKL";
        String prefix2 = "*+AB-CD";

        System.out.println("Infix of '" + prefix1 + "' : " + prefixToInfix(prefix1));
        System.out.println("Infix of '" + prefix2 + "' : " + prefixToInfix(prefix2));
    }
}
```

## Example Execution

### Example 1:
**Input:** `*-A/BC-/AKL`

| Character | Action                                  | Stack                           |
