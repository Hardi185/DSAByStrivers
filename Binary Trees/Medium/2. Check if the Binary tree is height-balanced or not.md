# Problem Statement:
Given a Binary Tree, return true if it is a Balanced Binary Tree else return false. A Binary Tree is balanced if, for all nodes in the tree, the difference between left and right subtree height is not more than 1.

## Examples

```yaml
Example 1:
Input:Binary Tree: 3 9 20 -1 -1 15 7
```

```yaml
Output: True, This is a Balanced Binary Tree.
Explanation: The difference in the height of left and right subtree is 1 hence the tree is balanced.

Example 2:
Input:Binary Tree: 1 3 2 5 4 -1 -1 7 6 
````                

```yaml
Output : False, this is not a Balanced Binary Tree.
Explanation: The difference in the height of left and right subtree is 2 hence the tree is not balanced.
