# Problem Statement:
Given a Binary Tree, return true if it is a Balanced Binary Tree else return false. A Binary Tree is balanced if, for all nodes in the tree, the difference between left and right subtree height is not more than 1.

## Examples

```yaml
Example 1:
Input:Binary Tree: 3 9 20 -1 -1 15 7
```

```yaml
Output: True, This is a Balanced Binary Tree.
Explanation: The difference in the height of left and right subtree is 1 hence the tree is balanced.

## Brute Force Approach

```java                              
// Node structure for the binary tree
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    // Constructor to initialize
    // the node with a value
    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }
}

class Solution {
    // Function to check if a binary tree is balanced
    public boolean isBalanced(Node root) {
        // If the tree is empty, it's balanced
        if (root == null) {
            return true;
        }

        // Calculate the height of left and right subtrees
        int leftHeight = getHeight(root.left);
        int rightHeight = getHeight(root.right);

        // Check if the absolute difference in heights
        // of left and right subtrees is <= 1
        if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) <= 1 &&
            isBalanced(root.left) &&
            isBalanced(root.right)) {
            return true;
        }

        // If any condition fails, the tree is unbalanced
        return false;
    }

    // Function to calculate the height of a subtree
    public int getHeight(Node root) {
        // Base case: if the current node is NULL,
        // return 0 (height of an empty tree)
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Recursively calculate the height
        // of left and right subtrees
        int leftHeight = getHeight(root.left);
        int rightHeight = getHeight(root.right);

        // Return the maximum height of left and right subtrees
        // plus 1 (to account for the current node)
        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
}

// Main function
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a sample binary tree
        Node root = new Node(1);
        root.left = new Node(2);
        root.right = new Node(3);
        root.left.left = new Node(4);
        root.left.right = new Node(5);
        root.left.right.right = new Node(6);
        root.left.right.right.right = new Node(7);

        // Creating an instance of the Solution class
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Checking if the tree is balanced
        if (solution.isBalanced(root)) {
            System.out.println("The tree is balanced.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The tree is not balanced.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(N2) where N is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree.This arises as we calculate the height of each node and to calculate the height for each node, we traverse the tree which is proportional to the number of nodes. Since this calculation is performed for each node in the tree, the complexity becomes: O(N x N) ~ O(N2).

**Space Complexity :** O(1) as no additional data structures or memory is allocated.O(H): Recursive Stack Space is used to calculate the height of the tree at each node which is proportional to the height of the tree.The recursive nature of the getHeight function, which incurs space on the call stack for each recursive call until it reaches the leaf nodes or the height of the tree.

## Optimal Approach
```java
                                
import java.lang.Math;

// Node structure for the binary tree
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    // Constructor to initialize
    // the node with a value
    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }
}

class Solution {

    // Function to check if a binary tree is balanced
    public boolean isBalanced(Node root) {
        // Check if the tree's height difference
        // between subtrees is less than 2
        // If not, return false; otherwise, return true
        return dfsHeight(root) != -1;
    }

    // Recursive function to calculate
    // the height of the tree
    public int dfsHeight(Node root) {
        // Base case: if the current node is NULL,
        // return 0 (height of an empty tree)
        if (root == null) return 0;

        // Recursively calculate the
        // height of the left subtree
        int leftHeight = dfsHeight(root.left);

        // If the left subtree is unbalanced,
        // propagate the unbalance status
        if (leftHeight == -1) 
            return -1;

        // Recursively calculate the
        // height of the right subtree
        int rightHeight = dfsHeight(root.right);

        // If the right subtree is unbalanced,
        // propagate the unbalance status
        if (rightHeight == -1) 
            return -1;

        // Check if the difference in height between
        // left and right subtrees is greater than 1
        // If it's greater, the tree is unbalanced,
        // return -1 to propagate the unbalance status
        if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1)  
            return -1;

        // Return the maximum height of left and
        // right subtrees, adding 1 for the current node
        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
}

public class Main {
    // Main function
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a sample binary tree
        Node root = new Node(1);
        root.left = new Node(2);
        root.right = new Node(3);
        root.left.left = new Node(4);
        root.left.right = new Node(5);
        root.left.right.right = new Node(6);
        root.left.right.right.right = new Node(7);

        // Creating an instance of the Solution class
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Checking if the tree is balanced
        if (solution.isBalanced(root)) {
            System.out.println("The tree is balanced.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The tree is not balanced.");
        }
    }
}                                   
```

**Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree. This complexity arises from visiting each node exactly once during the postorder traversal.

**Space Complexity :** O(1) as no additional space or data structures is created that is proportional to the input size of the tree. O(H) Recursive Stack Auxiliary Space : The recursion stack space is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion, which is the height of the binary tree denoted as H. In the balanced case it is log2N and in the worst case its N.
