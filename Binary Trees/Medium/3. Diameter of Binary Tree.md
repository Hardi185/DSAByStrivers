# Problem Statement: 
Given the root of the Binary Tree, return the length of its diameter. The Diameter of a Binary Tree is the longest distance between any two nodes of that tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

````yaml
Example 1:
Input:
````


````yaml
Output: 4
Explanation: The distance between the leftmost node 4 and the rightmost node 3 is 4, since this is the longest horizontal distance of the binary tree, hence its diameter.
