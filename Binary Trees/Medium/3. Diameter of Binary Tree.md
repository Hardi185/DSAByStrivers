# Problem Statement: 
Given the root of the Binary Tree, return the length of its diameter. The Diameter of a Binary Tree is the longest distance between any two nodes of that tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

````yaml
Output: 4
Explanation: The distance between the leftmost node 4 and the rightmost node 3 is 4, since this is the longest horizontal distance of the binary tree, hence its diameter.

## Brute Force Approach
````java
                                
// Importing necessary packages
import java.util.*;

// Node class for the binary tree
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    // Constructor to initialize
    // the node with a value
    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }
}

// Solution class
class Solution {
    // Global variable to
    // store the diameter
    int diameter = 0;

    // Function to calculate
    // the height of a subtree
    int calculateHeight(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Recursively calculate the
        // height of left and right subtrees
        int leftHeight = calculateHeight(node.left);
        int rightHeight = calculateHeight(node.right);

        // Calculate the diameter at the current
        // node and update the global variable
        diameter = Math.max(diameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);

        // Return the height
        // of the current subtree
        return 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    }

    // Function to find the
    // diameter of a binary tree
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(Node root) {
        // Start the recursive
        // traversal from the root
        calculateHeight(root);

        // Return the maximum diameter
        // found during traversal
        return diameter;
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    // Main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a sample binary tree
        Node root = new Node(1);
        root.left = new Node(2);
        root.right = new Node(3);
        root.left.left = new Node(4);
        root.left.right = new Node(5);
        root.left.right.right = new Node(6);
        root.left.right.right.right = new Node(7);

        // Creating an instance of the Solution class
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Calculate the diameter of the binary tree
        int diameter = solution.diameterOfBinaryTree(root);

        System.out.println("The diameter of the binary tree is: " + diameter);
    }
}
````
**Time Complexity:** O(N*N) where N is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree.

- This arises as we calculate the diameter of each node and to calculate the height of its left and right children, we traverse the tree which is proportional to the number of nodes.
- Since this calculation is performed for each node in the tree, the complexity becomes: O(N x N) ~ O(N2).

**Space Complexity :** O(1) as no additional data structures or memory is allocated.O(H): Recursive Stack Space is used to calculate the height of the tree at each node which is proportional to the height of the tree.The recursive nature of the getHeight function, which incurs space on the call stack for each recursive call until it reaches the leaf nodes or the height of the tree.

## Optimal Approach
````java

        data = val;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }

class Solution {
    // Function to find the
    // diameter of a binary tree
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(Node root) {
        // Initialize the variable to
        // store the diameter of the tree
        int[] diameter = new int[1];
        diameter[0] = 0;
        // Call the height function to traverse
        // the tree and calculate diameter
        height(root, diameter);
        // Return the calculated diameter
        return diameter[0];
    }

    // Function to calculate the height of
    // the tree and update the diameter
    private int height(Node node, int[] diameter) {
        // Base case: If the node is null,
        // return 0 indicating the
        // height of an empty tree
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;

        int[] lh = new int[1];
        int[] rh = new int[1];
        lh[0] = height(node.left, diameter);
        rh[0] = height(node.right, diameter);

        // Update the diameter with the maximum
        // of current diameter or sum of
        // left and right heights
        diameter[0] = Math.max(diameter[0], lh[0] + rh[0]);

        // Return the height of
        // the current node's subtree
        return 1 + Math.max(lh[0], rh[0]);
    }
}

        // Creating a sample binary tree

        root.left.left = new Node(4);

**Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree. This complexity arises from visiting each node exactly once during the postorder traversal.

**Space Complexity :** O(1) as no additional space or data structures is created that is proportional to the input size of the tree. O(H) Recursive Stack Auxiliary Space : The recursion stack space is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion, which is the height of the binary tree denoted as H. In the balanced case it is log2N and in the worst case its N.
