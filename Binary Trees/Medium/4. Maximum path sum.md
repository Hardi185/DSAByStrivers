# Problem Statement: 
Given a Binary Tree, determine the maximum sum achievable along any path within the tree. A path in a binary tree is defined as a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes is connected by an edge. Nodes can only appear once in the sequence, and the path is not required to start from the root. Identify and compute the maximum sum possible along any path within the given binary tree.

```yaml
Example 1:
Input:Binary Tree: -10 9 20 -1 -1 15 7
````

```yaml
Output: 42
Explanation: Out of all the paths possible in the Binary Tree, 15 -> 20 -> 7 has the greatest sum ie. 42.

```yaml
Example 2:
Input:Binary Tree: -2 2 1
````

```yaml
Output : 2
Explanation: Out of all the paths possible in the Binary Tree, a path starting and ending at the node with value 2 has the greatest sum ie. 2.

## Optimal Approach
```java
                            
// Importing necessary packages
import java.util.*;

// Node structure for the binary tree
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    // Constructor to initialize
    // the node with a value
    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    // Recursive function to find the maximum path sum
    // for a given subtree rooted at 'root'
    // The variable 'maxi' is a reference parameter
    // updated to store the maximum path sum encountered
    int findMaxPathSum(Node root, int[] maxi) {
        // Base case: If the current node is null, return 0
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Calculate the maximum path sum
        // for the left and right subtrees
        int leftMaxPath = Math.max(0, findMaxPathSum(root.left, maxi));
        int rightMaxPath = Math.max(0, findMaxPathSum(root.right, maxi));

        // Update the overall maximum
        // path sum including the current node
        maxi[0] = Math.max(maxi[0], leftMaxPath + rightMaxPath + root.data);

        // Return the maximum sum considering
        // only one branch (either left or right)
        // along with the current node
        return Math.max(leftMaxPath, rightMaxPath) + root.data;
    }

    // Function to find the maximum
    // path sum for the entire binary tree
    int maxPathSum(Node root) {
        // Initialize maxi to the
        // minimum possible integer value
        int[] maxi = {Integer.MIN_VALUE};

        // Call the recursive function to
        // find the maximum path sum
        findMaxPathSum(root, maxi);

        // Return the final maximum path sum
        return maxi[0];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a sample binary tree
        Node root = new Node(1);
        root.left = new Node(2);
        root.right = new Node(3);
        root.left.left = new Node(4);
        root.left.right = new Node(5);
        root.left.right.right = new Node(6);
        root.left.right.right.right = new Node(7);

        // Creating an instance of the Solution class
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Finding and printing the maximum path sum
        int maxPathSum = solution.maxPathSum(root);
        System.out.println("Maximum Path Sum: " + maxPathSum);
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree. This complexity arises from visiting each node exactly once during the recursive traversal.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) as no additional space or data structures is created that is proportional to the input size of the tree. O(H) Recursive Stack Auxiliary Space : The recursion stack space is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion, which is the height of the binary tree denoted as H. In the balanced case it is log2N and in the worst case its N.
