There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array cardPoints.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly k cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array cardPoints and the integer k, return the maximum score you can obtain.

```yaml

Example 1:
Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.

Example 2:
Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.

Example 3:
Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
Output: 55
Explanation: You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.

## Approach 1:
```java
public class CardGame {
    public static int maxScore(int[] cardPoints, int k) {
        int n = cardPoints.length;

        // Calculate the total sum of the first k cards from the left
        int leftsum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            leftsum += cardPoints[i];
        }

        // Calculate the total sum of the first k cards from the right
        // we can skip rughtsum calculation, as we'll do it further in reverse loop
        int rightsum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            rightsum += cardPoints[n - 1 - i];
        }

        // Initialize maxsum with the sum of the first k cards from the left
        int maxsum = leftsum;

        // Reverse loop: move one card from the right to the left in each iteration
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            leftsum -= cardPoints[i];              // Remove card from left
            rightsum += cardPoints[n - k + i];     // Add card from right
            maxsum = Math.max(maxsum, leftsum + rightsum);  // Update maxsum
        }

        return maxsum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] cardPoints1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1};
        int k1 = 3;
        System.out.println(maxScore(cardPoints1, k1)); // Output: 12

        int[] cardPoints2 = {2, 2, 2};
        int k2 = 2;
        System.out.println(maxScore(cardPoints2, k2)); // Output: 4

        int[] cardPoints3 = {9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9};
        int k3 = 7;
        System.out.println(maxScore(cardPoints3, k3)); // Output: 55
    }
}

```
