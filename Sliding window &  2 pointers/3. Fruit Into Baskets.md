You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array of arr[], where arr[i]  is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.
You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow :

You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of the baskets.

Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
Given the integer array of fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.

```yaml
Examples:
Input: arr[]= [2, 1, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick one fruit from all three trees. Please note that the type of fruits is same in the 1st and 3rd baskets.

Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation: It's optimal to pick from the last 5 trees. Please note that we do not pick the first basket as we would have to stop at thrid tree which would result in only 2 fruits collected.

## Approach 1:
```java
public class MaxFruits {

    public static int totalFruits(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int maxFruits = 0;

        // Iterate over all possible starting points
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Use a set to keep track of the types of fruits in the current subarray
            Set<Integer> basket = new HashSet<>();
            int count = 0;

            // Iterate over all possible ending points starting from i
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                // Add the current fruit type to the basket
                basket.add(arr[j]);
                
                // If the number of distinct fruit types exceeds 2, stop extending the subarray
                if (basket.size() > 2) {
                    break;
                }
                
                // Increase the count of fruits picked
                count++;
                
                // Update the maximum fruits picked so far
                maxFruits = Math.max(maxFruits, count);
            }
        }

        return maxFruits;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test Example 1
        int[] arr1 = {2, 1, 2};
        System.out.println("Maximum fruits that can be picked: " + totalFruits(arr1)); // Output: 3

        // Test Example 2
        int[] arr2 = {3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2};
        System.out.println("Maximum fruits that can be picked: " + totalFruits(arr2)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

## Approach 2:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class MaxFruits {

    public static int totalFruits(int[] arr) {
        int left = 0;
        int maxFruits = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> basket = new HashMap<>();

        for (int right = 0; right < arr.length; right++) {
            // Add the current fruit type to the basket
            basket.put(arr[right], basket.getOrDefault(arr[right], 0) + 1);

            // If the basket has more than 2 types of fruits, shrink the window from the left
            while (basket.size() > 2) {
                basket.put(arr[left], basket.get(arr[left]) - 1);
                if (basket.get(arr[left]) == 0) {
                    basket.remove(arr[left]);
                }
                left++; // Shrink the window from the left
            }

            // Calculate the number of fruits in the current valid window
            maxFruits = Math.max(maxFruits, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxFruits;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test Example 1
        int[] arr1 = {2, 1, 2};
        System.out.println("Maximum fruits that can be picked: " + totalFruits(arr1)); // Output: 3

        // Test Example 2
        int[] arr2 = {3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2};
        System.out.println("Maximum fruits that can be picked: " + totalFruits(arr2)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```
