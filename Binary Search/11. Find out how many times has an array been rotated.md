# PROBLEM:
Given an increasing sorted rotated array arr of distinct integers. The array is right-rotated k times. Find the value of k.
Let's suppose we have an array arr = [2, 4, 6, 9], so if we rotate it by 2 times so that it will look like this:
- After 1st Rotation : [9, 2, 4, 6]
- After 2nd Rotation : [6, 9, 2, 4]

### Example 1:

- Input: arr = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
- Output: 1
- Explanation: The given array is 5 1 2 3 4. The original sorted array is 1 2 3 4 5. We can see that the array was rotated 1 times to the right.

### Example 2:

- Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- Output: 0
- Explanation: The given array is not rotated.

**CODE:**
```java
public class tUf {
    public static int findKRotation(int[] arr) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int index = -1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            //Incase array is sorted then it is not rotated so lower index element will be rotation value (0 for sure)
            if (arr[low] <= arr[high]) {
                if (arr[low] < ans) {
                    index = low;
                    ans = arr[low];
                }
                break;
            }

            //if left part is sorted:
            if (arr[low] <= arr[mid]) {
                // keep the minimum:
                if (arr[low] < ans) {
                    index = low;
                    ans = arr[low];
                }

                // Eliminate left half:
                low = mid + 1;
            } else { //if right part is sorted:

                // keep the minimum:
                if (arr[mid] < ans) {
                    index = mid;
                    ans = arr[mid];
                }

                // Eliminate right half:
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3};
        int ans = findKRotation(arr);
        System.out.println("The array is rotated " + ans + " times.");
    }
}
```

### Algo:
- this problem is based on finding minimum on rotated sorted array
refer this link for that:
[Find Min in rotated sorted array](https://github.com/Hardi185/DSAByStrivers/blob/main/Binary%20Search/10.%20Find%20Min%20in%20rotated%20sorted%20array.md)
- Rotation count will be index of minimum here is how,
Let us suppose, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3 here is array
and min is 0 and index of 0 is 4 then array has been rotated 4 times as we can see.

- So we need to keep track of index of minimum value.

**Time Complexity:** O(logN), N = size of the given array.

**Reason:** We are basically using binary search to find the minimum.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Reason:** We have not used any extra data structures, this makes space complexity, even in the worst case as O(1).
