# PROBLEM:
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### Example 1:

- Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
- Output: 4

### Example 2:

- Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
- Output: -1

### Example 3:

- Input: nums = [1], target = 0
- Output: -1

## Approach 1: Naive Approach (Brute force): 

**CODE:**
```java
//linear search approach
public class Solution {
    public static int search(int[] arr, int k) {
         int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == k)
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
**Time Complexity:** O(N), N = size of the given array.
**Reason:** We have to iterate through the entire array to check if the target is present in the array.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
**Reason:** We have not used any extra data structures, this makes space complexity, even in the worst case as O(1).

## Approach 2: Optimal Approach(Using Binary Search): 

### Algo:
- If array is rotated either of the part will be sorted
1)  if left is sorted then check if element exists in that range 
  - if yes then traverse left side(by setting higher bound mid -1)
  - else traverse right side(by setting lower bound mid + 1)
2)  else if right is sorted then check if element exists in that range
  - if yes then traverse right side(by setting lower bound mid + 1)
  - else traverse left side(by setting higher bound mid - 1)

    
**Code:**
```java
//binary search approach
public class Solution {
    public static int search(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            // if mid points to the target
            if (arr[mid] == k)
                return mid;

            // if left part is sorted
            if (arr[low] <= arr[mid]) {
                if (arr[low] <= k && k <= arr[mid]) {
                    // element exists
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    // element does not exist
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            } else { // if right part is sorted
                if (arr[mid] <= k && k <= arr[high]) {
                    // element exists
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    // element does not exist
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(logN), N = size of the given array.
**Reason:** We are using binary search to search the target.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
**Reason:** We have not used any extra data structures, this makes space complexity, even in the worst case as O(1).
