# Canvas Painter's Partition Problem

## Problem Statement
Given an array of length `N` representing boards, where each element in the array represents the length of a board, and `K` painters are available to paint the boards, determine the minimum time required to paint all the boards. Each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint, and a painter can only paint continuous sections of the boards.

The goal is to divide the boards among the painters in such a way that the time taken by the painter who paints the most boards is minimized.

## Problem Constraints
- Each painter paints continuously and can handle only one section of boards.
- The number of painters `K` is given, and you need to find the optimal way to allocate the boards to minimize the maximum time taken by a painter.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**
- `N = 4`, `boards = [5, 5, 5, 5]`, `k = 2`

**Output:**
- `10`

**Explanation:**  
We can divide the boards into 2 equal-sized partitions, so each painter gets 10 units of the board, and the total time taken is 10.

### Example 2
**Input:**
- `N = 4`, `boards = [10, 20, 30, 40]`, `k = 2`

**Output:**
- `60`

**Explanation:**  
We can allocate the first 3 boards to one painter, and the last board to another painter. The total time required will be 60.

## Approach

This problem can be solved using **Binary Search** on the possible values of time, combined with a helper function to check how many painters are needed for a given maximum time limit.

### Observations:
1. **Minimum Time:** The minimum time will be equal to the largest board, i.e., `max(boards)`.
2. **Maximum Time:** The maximum time will be equal to the sum of all board lengths, i.e., `sum(boards)`.
3. **Time Range:** The time range for the binary search is between `max(boards)` and `sum(boards)`.

### Function: `countPainters(arr[], time)`
This function determines how many painters are needed if the maximum time a painter can work is `time`.

- Traverse through the array of boards, summing up the lengths until adding the next board would exceed the time limit.
- If it exceeds, assign a new painter and continue the process.

### Binary Search Logic:
- Start with `low = max(boards)` and `high = sum(boards)`.
- Perform binary search to find the minimum time such that we can assign the boards to `k` painters.
- For each midpoint value (`mid`), check how many painters are needed. If more than `k` painters are required, increase the `low` value; otherwise, adjust the `high` value.

## Code

### Approach 1: Naive Approach

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CanvasPainter {
    public static int countPainters(ArrayList<Integer> boards, int time) {
        int n = boards.size(); // size of array.
        int painters = 1;
        long boardsPainter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (boardsPainter + boards.get(i) <= time) {
                // allocate board to current painter
                boardsPainter += boards.get(i);
            } else {
                // allocate board to next painter
                painters++;
                boardsPainter = boards.get(i);
            }
        }
        return painters;
    }

    public static int findLargestMinDistance(ArrayList<Integer> boards, int k) {
        int low = Collections.max(boards);
        int high = boards.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();

        for (int time = low; time <= high; time++) {
            if (countPainters(boards, time) <= k) {
                return time;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> boards = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(10, 20, 30, 40));
        int k = 2;
        int ans = findLargestMinDistance(boards, k);
        System.out.println("The answer is: " + ans);
    }
}
```

## Approach 2: Optimized Approach (Using Binary Search)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CanvasPainter {
    public static int countPainters(ArrayList<Integer> boards, int time) {
        int n = boards.size(); // size of array.
        int painters = 1;
        long boardsPainter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (boardsPainter + boards.get(i) <= time) {
                // allocate board to current painter
                boardsPainter += boards.get(i);
            } else {
                // allocate board to next painter
                painters++;
                boardsPainter = boards.get(i);
            }
        }
        return painters;
    }

    public static int findLargestMinDistance(ArrayList<Integer> boards, int k) {
        int low = Collections.max(boards);
        int high = boards.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();

        // Apply binary search:
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            int painters = countPainters(boards, mid);
            if (painters > k) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> boards = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(10, 20, 30, 40));
        int k = 2;
        int ans = findLargestMinDistance(boards, k);
        System.out.println("The answer is: " + ans);
    }
}
```

## Time and Space Complexity
### Time Complexity:

**Naive Approach:** O(N * (sum(arr[]) - max(arr[]) + 1)), where N is the size of the array.
**Binary Search Approach:** O(N * log(sum(arr[]) - max(arr[]) + 1)), where N is the size of the array.

### Space Complexity: O(1) because no extra space is used besides the input array.
