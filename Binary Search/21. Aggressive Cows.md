# Aggressive Cows Problem

## Problem Statement
You are given an array `arr` of size `n` which denotes the position of stalls. You are also given an integer `k` which denotes the number of aggressive cows. Your task is to assign stalls to `k` cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.

### Example 1:
**Input Format:**
```
N = 6, k = 4, arr[] = {0,3,4,7,10,9}
```
**Result:**
```
3
```
**Explanation:**
The maximum possible minimum distance between any two cows will be 3 when 4 cows are placed at positions {0, 3, 7, 10}. Here the distances between cows are 3, 4, and 3 respectively. We cannot make the minimum distance greater than 3 in any way.

### Example 2:
**Input Format:**
```
N = 5, k = 2, arr[] = {4,2,1,3,6}
```
**Result:**
```
5
```
**Explanation:**
The maximum possible minimum distance between any two cows will be 5 when 2 cows are placed at positions {1, 6}.

## Why Do We Need to Sort the Stalls?
To arrange the cows in a consecutive manner while ensuring a certain distance between them, the initial step is to sort the stalls based on their positions. In a sorted array, the minimum distance will always be obtained from any two consecutive cows. Arranging the cows in a consecutive manner does not necessarily mean placing them in consecutive stalls.

### Example:
Given stalls array: `{1,2,8,4,9}`
After sorting: `{1, 2, 4, 8, 9}`

Given `k = 3` (number of cows), we aim to maximize the minimum distance between them.

## Observations:
1. **Minimum possible distance between 2 cows:** The minimum possible distance is `1` as the minimum distance between 2 consecutive stalls is `1`.
2. **Maximum possible distance between 2 cows:** The maximum possible distance is `max(stalls[]) - min(stalls[])`. This occurs when we place 2 cows at the two ends of the sorted stalls array.

From these observations, our answer lies in the range `[1, max(stalls[]) - min(stalls[])]`.

## Placing Cows While Maintaining a Distance `dist`
1. Position the first cow in the first stall.
2. Iterate through the sorted array. Place the next cow if the distance from the last placed cow is at least `dist`.
3. Continue until all cows are placed or the stalls are exhausted.

### Function: `canWePlace(stalls[], dist, k)`
- **Input:** Sorted array of stalls, required distance `dist`, number of cows `k`.
- **Output:** `true` if we can place `k` cows with at least `dist` between them; otherwise, `false`.

## Approach 1: Naive Approach

```java
import java.util.*;

public class AggressiveCows {
    public static boolean canWePlace(int[] stalls, int dist, int cows) {
        int cntCows = 1; // Number of cows placed
        int last = stalls[0]; // Position of the last placed cow
        for (int i = 1; i < stalls.length; i++) {
            if (stalls[i] - last >= dist) {
                cntCows++;
                last = stalls[i];
            }
            if (cntCows >= cows) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static int aggressiveCows(int[] stalls, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(stalls);
        int limit = stalls[stalls.length - 1] - stalls[0];
        for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) {
            if (!canWePlace(stalls, i, k)) {
                return i - 1;
            }
        }
        return limit;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] stalls = {0, 3, 4, 7, 10, 9};
        int k = 4;
        int ans = aggressiveCows(stalls, k);
        System.out.println("The maximum possible minimum distance is: " + ans);
    }
}
```

### Complexity:
**Time Complexity:**
- `O(NlogN)` for sorting.
- `O(N * (max(stalls[]) - min(stalls[])))` for checking all possible distances.

**Space Complexity:**
- `O(1)` as no extra space is used.

## Approach 2: Optimal Approach (Using Binary Search)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class AggressiveCows {
    public static boolean canWePlace(int[] stalls, int dist, int cows) {
        int cntCows = 1; // Number of cows placed
        int last = stalls[0]; // Position of the last placed cow
        for (int i = 1; i < stalls.length; i++) {
            if (stalls[i] - last >= dist) {
                cntCows++;
                last = stalls[i];
            }
            if (cntCows >= cows) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static int aggressiveCows(int[] stalls, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(stalls);
        int low = 1, high = stalls[stalls.length - 1] - stalls[0];
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (canWePlace(stalls, mid, k)) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return high;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] stalls = {0, 3, 4, 7, 10, 9};
        int k = 4;
        int ans = aggressiveCows(stalls, k);
        System.out.println("The maximum possible minimum distance is: " + ans);
    }
}
```

### Complexity:
**Time Complexity:**
- `O(NlogN)` for sorting.
- `O(N * log(max(stalls[]) - min(stalls[])))` for binary search.

**Space Complexity:**
- `O(1)` as no extra space is used.
