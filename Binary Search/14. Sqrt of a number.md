# Problem Statement: 
You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to find and return its square root. If ‘n’ is not a perfect square, then return the floor value of 'sqrt(n)'.

### Example 1:
- Input Format: n = 36
- Result: 6
- Explanation: 6 is the square root of 36.

### Example 2:
- Input Format: n = 28
- Result: 5
- Explanation: Square root of 28 is approximately 5.292. So, the floor value will be 5.

## Approach 1: Naive Approach(Using linear search): 

**Code:**
```java
import java.util.*;

public class tUf {
    public static int floorSqrt(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        // linear search on the answer space
        for (long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            long val = i * i;
            if (val <= (long) n) {
                ans = (int) i;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 28;
        int ans = floorSqrt(n);
        System.out.println("The floor of square root of " + n + " is: " + ans);
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(N), N = the given number.
**Reason:** Since we are using linear search, we traverse the entire answer space.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

## Approach 2: First Approach(Using in-built sqrt() function): 

**Code:**
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.Math;

public class tUf {
    public static int floorSqrt(int n) {
        int ans = (int) Math.sqrt(n);
        return ans;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 28;
        int ans = floorSqrt(n);
        System.out.println("The floor of square root of " + n + " is: " + ans);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **`Math.sqrt()`**: The `Math.sqrt()` function has a constant time complexity of \( O(1) \) as it is optimized at the hardware or library level.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: \( O(1) \)

### Space Complexity
- The function does not use additional data structures, only a few variables.
- **Overall Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)

## Approach 3: Optimal Approach(Using binary search): 

**Code:**
```java
import java.util.*;

public class tUf {
    public static int floorSqrt(int n) {
        int low = 1, high = n;
        //Binary search on the answers:
        while (low <= high) {
            long mid = (low + high) / 2;
            long val = mid * mid;
            if (val <= (long)(n)) {
                //eliminate the left half:
                low = (int)(mid + 1);
            } else {
                //eliminate the right half:
                high = (int)(mid - 1);
            }
        }
        return high;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 28;
        int ans = floorSqrt(n);
        System.out.println("The floor of square root of " + n + " is: " + ans);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- O(logN), N = size of the given array.
- Reason: We are basically using the Binary Search algorithm.

### Space Complexity: 
O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
