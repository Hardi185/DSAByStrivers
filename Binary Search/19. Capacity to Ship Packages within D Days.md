# Shipment Capacity Problem

## Problem Statement
You are the owner of a shipment company that uses conveyor belts to ship packages from one port to another. The packages must be shipped within `d` days.

Given:
- An array `weights[]` that contains the weights of the packages.
- The packages are loaded onto the conveyor belts every day in the same order as they appear in the array.
- The loaded weights must not exceed the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Find the **least-weight capacity** of the ship required to ship all packages within `d` days.

### Example 1
**Input**:
```plaintext
N = 5, weights[] = {5, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, d = 5
```
**Output**:
```plaintext
9
```
**Explanation**:
If the ship capacity is 9, the shipment will be done as follows:
| Day | Weights Loaded | Total Weight |
|-----|----------------|--------------|
| 1   | 5, 4          | 9            |
| 2   | 5, 2          | 7            |
| 3   | 3, 4          | 7            |
| 4   | 5             | 5            |
| 5   | 6             | 6            |

### Example 2
**Input**:
```plaintext
N = 10, weights[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, d = 1
```
**Output**:
```plaintext
55
```
**Explanation**:
If all packages must be shipped in a single day, the ship capacity should be the sum of all weights, i.e., 55.

---

## Observations
1. **Minimum Ship Capacity**:
   - The ship's minimum capacity must be at least the maximum weight in the array because every package must fit on the ship.

2. **Maximum Ship Capacity**:
   - The maximum capacity is the sum of all weights because this would allow all packages to be shipped in a single day.

3. **Search Space**:
   - The optimal ship capacity lies between `max(weights[])` and `sum(weights[])`.

4. **Days Calculation**:
   - To calculate the number of days required for a given capacity, use the `findDays` function.

---

## Approach 1: Naive Approach
This approach checks every possible capacity from `max(weights[])` to `sum(weights[])` and finds the minimum capacity that ships all packages within `d` days.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class ShipmentCapacity {
    public static int findDays(int[] weights, int cap) {
        int days = 1;
        int load = 0;
        for (int weight : weights) {
            if (load + weight > cap) {
                days++;
                load = weight;
            } else {
                load += weight;
            }
        }
        return days;
    }

    public static int leastWeightCapacity(int[] weights, int d) {
        int maxi = Integer.MIN_VALUE, sum = 0;
        for (int weight : weights) {
            sum += weight;
            maxi = Math.max(maxi, weight);
        }

        for (int cap = maxi; cap <= sum; cap++) {
            if (findDays(weights, cap) <= d) {
                return cap;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {5, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
        int d = 5;
        System.out.println("The minimum capacity should be: " + leastWeightCapacity(weights, d));
    }
}
```

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * (sum(weights[]) - max(weights[]) + 1))
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

## Approach 2: Optimal Approach (Using Binary Search)
This approach optimizes the search for the minimum capacity by using binary search within the range `[max(weights[]), sum(weights[])]`.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class ShipmentCapacity {
    public static int findDays(int[] weights, int cap) {
        int days = 1;
        int load = 0;
        for (int weight : weights) {
            if (load + weight > cap) {
                days++;
                load = weight;
            } else {
                load += weight;
            }
        }
        return days;
    }

    public static int leastWeightCapacity(int[] weights, int d) {
        int low = Integer.MIN_VALUE, high = 0;
        for (int weight : weights) {
            high += weight;
            low = Math.max(low, weight);
        }

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (findDays(weights, mid) <= d) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {5, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
        int d = 5;
        System.out.println("The minimum capacity should be: " + leastWeightCapacity(weights, d));
    }
}
```

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * log(sum(weights[]) - max(weights[]) + 1))
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## Comparison of Approaches
| Metric              | Naive Approach                 | Optimal Approach             |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(N * range)                  | O(N * log(range))           |
| **Space Complexity**| O(1)                          | O(1)                        |
| **Use Case**        | Small input sizes             | Large input sizes           |

## Conclusion
Using binary search significantly improves the efficiency of finding the minimum ship capacity, especially for large input sizes. This solution is robust and works efficiently for a wide range of constraints.
