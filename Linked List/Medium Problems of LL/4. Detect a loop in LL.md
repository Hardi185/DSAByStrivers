### Examples

```yaml
Example 1:
Input Format:
LL: 1 2 3 4 5
Result: True[First Image]
Explanation: The last node with the value of 5 has its 'next' pointer pointing back to a previous node with the value of 3. This has resulted in a loop, hence we return true.

Example 2:
Input Format:
LL: 1 2 3 4 9 9
Result: False[Second Image]
Explanation: : In this example, the linked list does not have a loop hence returns false.
```
