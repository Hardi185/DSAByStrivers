# Problem Statement: 
Given a linked list containing ‘N’ head nodes where every node in the linked list contains two pointers:

- ‘Next’ points to the next node in the list
- ‘Child’ pointer to a linked list where the current node is the head
- Each of these child linked lists is in sorted order and connected by a 'child' pointer. Your task is to flatten this linked list such that all nodes appear in a single layer or level in a 'sorted order'.

### Example:

**Output:**

**Explaination:**  Flatten the linked list into a single level sorted order and traverse the nodes in such a manner that the child linked lists are merged into the main list in the sorted order.
