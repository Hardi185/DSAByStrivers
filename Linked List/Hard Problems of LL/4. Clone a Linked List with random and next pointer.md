# Problem Statement:
Given a linked list where every node in the linked list contains two pointers:

- ‘next’ which points to the next node in the list.
- ‘random’ which points to a random node in the list or ‘null’.
- Create a ‘deep copy’ of the given linked list and return it.

### Example:

**OUTPUT:**

**EXPLANATION:**

A deep copy of the linked list has to be created while maintaining all ‘next’ and ‘random’ pointers to the appropriate new nodes. Additional memory allocation is done while creating a duplicate set of nodes and managing their pointer relationships.
